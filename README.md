# Challenge 1: Code refactor

## Code refactor

This first challenge is an interesting one as this requires you to think from both end-user and developer point of view.
<br/><br/>

## Given User Story

`AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines`
<br/><br/>

### Motivation
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

### What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
* Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.
* Examples of semantic elements: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.
<br/><br/>

### Things I have considered to refactor the given starter code:
* Removed all the non-semantic elements from HTML file and replaced with semantic elements
* Reworked on the CSS file to maintain the style of the webpage
* Added proper heading in sequential order
* Added comments in the code to explain what was changed and why it was changed
<br/><br/>

### Things I have learnt during this challenge:
* Think like a user of the webpage
* Have patience until we achieve our result and never give-up (this is true when CSS styling crashes on you)
